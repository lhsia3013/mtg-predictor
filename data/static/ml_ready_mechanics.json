    "definition": "Trample is a static ability that modifies the rules for assigning an attacking creature\u2019s combat damage. The ability has no effect when a creature with trample is blocking or is dealing noncombat damage. (See rule 510, \u201cCombat Damage Step.\u201d)  The controller of an attacking creature with trample first assigns damage to the creature(s) blocking it. Once all those blocking creatures are assigned lethal damage, any excess damage is assigned as its controller chooses among those blocking creatures and the player, planeswalker, or battle the creature is attacking. When checking for assigned lethal damage, take into account damage already marked on the creature and damage from other creatures that\u2019s being assigned  during the same combat damage step, but not any abilities or effects that might change the amount of damage that\u2019s actually dealt. The attacking creature\u2019s controller need not assign lethal damage to all those blocking creatures but in that case can\u2019t assign any damage to the player or planeswalker it\u2019s attacking. Example: A 2/2 creature that can block an additional creature blocks two attackers: a 1/1 with no abilities and a 3/3 with trample. The active player could assign 1 damage from the first attacker and 1 damage from the second to the blocking creature, and 2 damage to the defending player from the creature with trample. Example: A 6/6 green creature with trample is blocked by a 2/2 creature with protection from green. The attacking creature\u2019s controller must assign at least 2 damage to the blocker, even though that damage will be prevented by the blocker\u2019s protection ability. The attacking creature\u2019s controller can divide the rest of the damage as they choose between the blocking creature and the defending player.  Trample over planeswalkers is a variant of trample that modifies the rules for assigning combat damage to planeswalkers. The controller of a creature with trample over planeswalkers assigns that creature\u2019s combat damage as described in rule 702.19b, with one exception. If that creature is attacking a planeswalker, after lethal damage is assigned to all blocking creatures and damage at least equal to the loyalty of the planeswalker the creature is attacking is assigned to that planeswalker, further excess damage may be assigned as the attacking creature\u2019s controller chooses among those blocking creatures, that planeswalker, and that planeswalker\u2019s controller. When checking for assigned damage equal to a planeswalker\u2019s loyalty, take into account damage from other creatures that\u2019s being assigned during the same combat damage step, but not any abilities or effects that might change the amount of damage that\u2019s actually dealt. Example: A player controls a planeswalker with three loyalty counters that is being attacked by a 1/1 with no abilities and a 7/7 with trample over planeswalkers. The active player could assign 1 damage from the first attacker and 2 damage from the second to the planeswalker and 5 damage to the defending player from the creature with trample over planeswalkers.  If an attacking creature with trample or trample over planeswalkers is blocked, but there are no creatures blocking it when damage is assigned, its damage is assigned to the defending player and/or planeswalker as though all blocking creatures have been assigned lethal damage.  If a creature with trample over planeswalkers is attacking a planeswalker and that planeswalker is removed from combat, the creature\u2019s damage may be assigned to the defending player once all blocking creatures have been dealt lethal damage or, if there are no blocking creatures when damage is assigned, all its damage is assigned to the defending player. This is an exception to rule 506.4c, and it does not cause the creature to be attacking that player.  If a creature without trample over planeswalkers is attacking a planeswalker, none of its combat damage can be assigned to the defending player, even if that planeswalker has been removed from combat or the damage the attacking creature could assign is greater than the planeswalker\u2019s loyalty.  Multiple instances of trample on the same creature are redundant. Multiple instances of trample over planeswalkers on the same creature are redundant.",

If an effect causes a permanent to lose banding, the permanent loses all \u201cbands with other\u201d abilities as well.  As a player declares attackers, they may declare that one or more attacking creatures with banding and up to one attacking creature without banding (even if it has \u201cbands with other\u201d) are all in a \u201cband.\u201d They may also declare that one or more attacking [quality] creatures with \u201cbands with other [quality]\u201d and any number of other attacking [quality] creatures are all in a band. A player may declare as many attacking bands as they want, but each creature may be a member of only one of them. (Defending players can\u2019t declare bands but may use banding in a different way; see rule 702.22j.)  All creatures in an attacking band must attack the same player, planeswalker, or battle.  Once an attacking band has been announced, it lasts for the rest of combat, even if something later removes banding or \u201cbands with other\u201d from one or more of the creatures in the band.  An attacking creature that\u2019s removed from combat is also removed from the band it was in.  Banding doesn\u2019t cause attacking creatures to share abilities, nor does it remove any abilities. The attacking creatures in a band are separate permanents.  If an attacking creature becomes blocked by a creature, each other creature in the same band as the attacking creature becomes blocked by that same blocking creature. Example: A player attacks with a band consisting of a creature with flying and a creature with swampwalk. The defending player, who controls a Swamp, can block the flying creature if able. If they do, then the creature with swampwalk will also become blocked by the blocking creature(s).  If one member of a band would become blocked due to an effect, the entire band becomes blocked.  During the combat damage step, if an attacking creature is being blocked by a creature with banding, or by both a [quality] creature with \u201cbands with other [quality]\u201d and another [quality] creature, the defending player (rather than the active player) chooses how the attacking creature\u2019s damage is assigned.

It can\u2019t affect or be affected by anything else in the game. A permanent that phases out is removed from combat. (See rule 506.4.) Example: You control three creatures, one of which is phased out. You cast a spell that says \u201cDraw a card for each creature you control.\u201d You draw two cards. Example: You control a phased-out creature. You cast a spell that says \u201cDestroy all creatures.\u201d The phased-out creature is not destroyed.  If a permanent phases in, its status changes to \u201cphased in.\u201d The game once again treats it as though it exists.  The phasing event doesn\u2019t actually cause a permanent to change zones or control, even though it\u2019s treated as though it\u2019s not on the battlefield and not under its controller\u2019s control while it\u2019s phased out. Zone-change triggers don\u2019t trigger when a permanent phases in or out. Tokens continue to exist on the battlefield while phased out. Counters and stickers remain on a permanent while it\u2019s phased out. Effects that check a phased-in permanent\u2019s history won\u2019t treat the phasing event as having caused the permanent to leave or enter the battlefield or its controller\u2019s control.  If a continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or ability modifies the characteristics or changes the controller of any objects, a phased-out permanent won\u2019t be included in the set of affected objects. This includes continuous effects that reference the permanent specifically, unless they also specifically refer to the permanent as phased out.  Continuous effects that affect a phased-out permanent may expire while that permanent is phased out. If so, they will no longer affect that permanent once it\u2019s phased in. In particular, effects with \u201cfor as long as\u201d durations that track that permanent (see rule 611.2b) end when that permanent phases out because they can no longer see it.  When a permanent phases out, any Auras, Equipment, or Fortifications attached to that permanent phase out at the same time. This alternate way of phasing out is known as phasing out \u201cindirectly.\u201d An Aura, Equipment, or Fortification that phased out indirectly won\u2019t phase in by itself, but instead phases in along with the permanent it\u2019s attached to.  If an object would simultaneously phase out directly and indirectly, it just phases out indirectly.  An Aura, Equipment, or Fortification that phased out directly will phase in attached to the object or player it was attached to when it phased out, if that object is still in the same zone or that player is still in the game. If not, that Aura, Equipment, or Fortification phases in unattached. State-based actions apply as appropriate. (See rules 704.5m and 704.5n.)  Abilities that trigger when a permanent becomes attached or unattached from an object or player don\u2019t trigger when that permanent phases in or out.  Phased-out permanents owned by a player who leaves the game also leave the game. This doesn\u2019t cause zone-change abilities to trigger. See rule 800.4.  If an effect causes a player to skip their untap step, the phasing event simply doesn\u2019t occur that turn.   In a multiplayer game, game rules may cause a phased-out permanent to leave the game or to be exiled once a player leaves the game. (See rules 800.4a and 800.4c.) If a phased-out permanent phased out under the control of a player who has left the game, that permanent phases in during the next untap step after that player\u2019s next turn would have begun.

To cast a card using its morph ability, turn it face down and announce that you\u2019re using a morph ability. It becomes a 2/2 face-down creature card with no text, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost. Any effects or prohibitions that would apply to casting a card with these characteristics (and not the face-up card\u2019s characteristics) are applied to casting this card. These values are the copiable values of that object\u2019s characteristics. (See rule 613, \u201cInteraction of  Continuous Effects,\u201d and rule 707, \u201cCopying Objects.\u201d) Put it onto the stack (as a face-down spell with the same characteristics), and pay {3} rather than pay its mana cost. This follows the rules for paying alternative costs. You can use a morph ability to cast a card from any zone from which you could normally cast it. When the spell resolves, it enters the battlefield with the same characteristics the spell had. The morph effect applies to the face-down object wherever it is, and it ends when the permanent is turned face up.  You can\u2019t normally cast a card face down. A morph ability allows you to do so.  Any time you have priority, you may turn a face-down permanent you control with a morph ability face up. This is a special action; it doesn\u2019t use the stack (see rule 116). To do this, show all players what the permanent\u2019s morph cost would be if it were face up, pay that cost, then turn the permanent face up. (If the permanent wouldn\u2019t have a morph cost if it were face up, it can\u2019t be turned face up this way.) The morph effect on it ends, and it regains its normal characteristics. Any abilities relating to the permanent entering the battlefield don\u2019t trigger when it\u2019s turned face up and don\u2019t have any effect, because the permanent has already entered the battlefield.  If a permanent\u2019s morph cost includes X, other abilities of that permanent may also refer to X. The value of X in those abilities is equal to the value of X chosen as the morph special action was taken.  See rule 708, \u201cFace-Down Spells and Permanents,\u201d for more information about how to cast cards with a morph ability.",

If you do, you pay [cost] rather than its mana cost.\u201d Casting a spell using its bestow ability follows the rules for paying alternative costs (see 601.2b and 601.2f\u2013h).  As a spell cast bestowed is put onto the stack, it becomes an Aura enchantment and gains enchant creature. It is a bestowed Aura spell, and the permanent it becomes as it resolves will be a bestowed Aura. These effects last until the spell or the permanent it becomes ceases to be bestowed (see rules 702.103e\u2013g). Because the spell is an Aura spell, its controller must choose a legal target for that spell as defined by its enchant creature ability and rule 601.2c. See also rule 303.4.   If a bestowed Aura spell is copied, the copy is also a bestowed Aura spell. Any rule that refers to a spell cast bestowed applies to the copy as well.  When casting a spell bestowed, only its characteristics as modified by the bestow ability are evaluated to determine if it can be cast. Example: Aether Storm is an enchantment with the ability \u201cCreature spells can\u2019t be cast.\u201d This effect doesn\u2019t stop a creature card with bestow from being cast bestowed.

As a bestowed Aura spell begins resolving, if its target is illegal, it ceases to be bestowed and the effect making it an Aura spell ends. It continues resolving as a creature spell. See rule 608.3b.  If a bestowed Aura becomes unattached, it ceases to be bestowed. If a bestowed Aura is attached to an illegal object or player, it becomes unattached and ceases to be bestowed. This is an exception to rule 704.5m.  If a bestowed Aura phases in unattached, it ceases to be bestowed. See rule 702.26, \u201cPhasing.\u201d",

Each partner ability allows you to designate two legendary cards as your commander rather than one. Each partner ability has its own requirements for those two commanders. The partner abilities are: partner, partner with [name], friends forever, choose a Background, and Doctor\u2019s companion.  Your deck must contain exactly 100 cards, including its two commanders. Both commanders begin the game in the command zone.  A rule or effect that refers to your commander\u2019s color identity refers to the combined color identities of your two commanders. See rule 903.4.  Except for determining the color identity of your commander, the two commanders function independently. When casting a commander with partner, ignore how many times your other commander has been cast (see rule 903.8). When determining whether a player has been dealt 21 or more combat damage by the same commander, consider damage from each of your two commanders separately (see rule 903.10a).  If an effect refers to your commander while you have two commanders, it refers to either one. If an effect causes you to perform an action on your commander and it could affect both, you choose which it refers to at the time the effect is applied.  Different partner abilities are distinct from one another and cannot be combined. For example, you cannot designate two cards as your commander if one of them has \u201cpartner\u201d and the other has \u201cpartner with [name].\u201d  If a legendary card has more than one partner ability, you may choose which one to use when designating your commander, but you can\u2019t use both. Notably, no partner ability or combination of partner abilities can ever let a player have more than two commanders.  \u201cPartner\u201d means \u201cYou may designate two legendary creature cards as your commander rather than one if each of them has partner.\u201d  \u201cPartner with [name]\u201d represents two abilities. It means \u201cYou may designate two legendary creature cards as your commander rather than one if each has a \u2018partner with [name]\u2019 ability with the other\u2019s name\u201d and \u201cWhen this permanent enters, target player may search their library for a card named [name], reveal it, put it into their hand, then shuffle.\u201d  \u201cFriends forever\u201d means \u201cYou may designate two legendary creature cards as your commander rather than one if each of them has friends forever.\u201d  \u201cChoose a Background\u201d means \u201cYou may designate two cards as your commander rather than one if one of them is this card and the other is a legendary Background enchantment card.\u201d You can\u2019t designate two cards as your commander if one has a \u201cchoose a Background\u201d ability and the other is not a legendary Background enchantment card, and legendary Background enchantment cards can\u2019t be your commander unless you have also designated a commander with \u201cchoose a Background.\u201d  \u201cDoctor\u2019s companion\u201d means \u201cYou may designate two legendary creature cards as your commander rather than one if one of them is this card and the other is a legendary Time Lord Doctor creature card that has no other creature types.\u201d   If an effect refers to a partner ability by name, it means only that partner ability and not any others.

To double a creature\u2019s power, that creature gets +X/+0, where X is that creature\u2019s power as the spell or ability that doubles its power resolves.

    "definition": "A spell or ability may instruct players to exchange something (for example, life totals or control of two permanents) as part of its resolution. When such a spell or ability resolves, if the entire exchange can\u2019t be completed, no part of the exchange occurs. Example: If a spell attempts to exchange control of two target creatures but one of those creatures is destroyed before the spell resolves, the spell does nothing to the other creature.  When control of two permanents is exchanged, if those permanents are controlled by different players, each of those players simultaneously gains control of the permanent that was controlled by the other player. If, on the other hand, those permanents are controlled by the same player, the exchange effect does nothing.  When life totals are exchanged, each player gains or loses the amount of life necessary to equal the other player\u2019s previous life total. Replacement effects may modify these gains and losses, and triggered abilities may trigger on them. A player who can\u2019t gain life can\u2019t be given a higher life total this way, and a player who can\u2019t lose life can\u2019t be given a lower life total this way (see rules 119.7\u20138).  Some spells or abilities may instruct a player to exchange cards in one zone with cards in a different zone (for example, exiled cards and cards in a player\u2019s hand). These spells and abilities work the same as other \u201cexchange\u201d spells and abilities, except they can exchange the cards only if all the cards are owned by the same player, and they can exchange the cards even if one zone is empty.  If a card in one zone is exchanged with a card in a different zone, and either of them is attached to an object, that card stops being attached to that object and the other card becomes attached to that object.  If a spell or ability instructs a player to simply exchange two zones, and one of the zones is empty, the cards in the zones are still exchanged.  A spell or ability may instruct a player to exchange two numerical values. In such an exchange, each value becomes equal to the previous value of the other. If either of those values is a life total, the affected player gains or loses the amount of life necessary to equal the other value. Replacement effects may modify this gain or loss, and triggered abilities may trigger on it. A player who can\u2019t gain life can\u2019t be given a higher life total this way, and a player who can\u2019t lose life can\u2019t be given a lower life total this way (see rules 119.7\u20138). If either of those values is a power or toughness, a continuous effect is created setting that power or toughness to the other value (see rule 613.4b). This rule does not apply to spells and abilities that switch a creature\u2019s power and toughness.  One card (Exchange of Words) instructs a player to exchange the text boxes of two creatures. This creates a text-changing effect (see rule 612, \u201cText-Changing Effects\u201d). In such an exchange, the rules text of each permanent becomes the previous rules text of the other.",
